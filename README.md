### Hi, I'm Olajide ðŸ‘‹

I am a problem solver, software engineer with focus on turning web ideas into visual reality as a frontend engineer.

Looking to join a team of highly skilled and passion-driven engineers while contributing to a meaningful project.

While not reading, I invest other quality leisure moments watching sports especially basketball. A lover of dogs (yet to own one)
